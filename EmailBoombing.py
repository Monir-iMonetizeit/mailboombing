# üìß Email Sending Demo (Educational Only)

The **Email Sending Demo Tool** is a Python-based application created by **Monir Hasan** for **educational and demonstration purposes**. Its primary goal is to teach students and beginners how email automation works using Python‚Äôs built-in `smtplib` library, Gmail‚Äôs SMTP server, and modern authentication methods such as **App Passwords**.  

This project helps learners understand the core concepts of **SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol)**, which is the foundation of email communication on the internet. By working with this script, students can explore how email headers, subjects, recipients, and message bodies are structured and delivered. Unlike traditional tutorials, this tool includes **interactive input prompts**, a **custom ASCII banner**, and an **author information section** to make the learning experience engaging and professional.  

Users are able to:  
- Enter their Gmail address and authenticate securely using a **16-character Gmail App Password** (never the normal Gmail password).  
- Define their display name, recipient‚Äôs email, subject, and message body.  
- Specify how many test emails should be sent in sequence.  
- Watch real-time progress updates for each email sent, with clear success or error messages.  

One of the unique aspects of this project is the inclusion of a **disclaimer and warning message**. The script strongly emphasizes that it must **not** be used for sending spam or unsolicited emails. Instead, it is designed purely for **classroom education, demonstrations, and controlled testing environments**.  

The script runs on **Python 3.x** and is compatible with most operating systems, including Windows (CMD/PowerShell), Linux, and macOS. It also leverages the `pyfiglet` and `colorama` libraries to display an attractive banner and colorful terminal output, ensuring that the project feels more like a professional tool rather than a plain script.  

This project reflects **Monir Hasan‚Äôs commitment to digital education** and his professional background as a **Sales Manager & Affiliate Specialist at iMonetizeIt**, with more than **five years of experience in digital marketing and CPA monetization**. By blending technical concepts with real-world caution and responsibility, this demo tool stands as an excellent example of how software projects can be both **educational and ethical**.  

‚ö†Ô∏è **Reminder:** Misusing this script for spamming or malicious purposes is strictly prohibited and may be illegal. Always use it in a safe, controlled, and educational context.
